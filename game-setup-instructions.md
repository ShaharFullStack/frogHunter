# Adventure World Game Setup Instructions

Follow these instructions to fix the issues with your Adventure World game and get it running properly.

## Error 1: Missing Audio Files

The error `GET https://threejs.org/examples/sounds/click.ogg 404 (Not Found)` occurs because the game is trying to load sound files from the Three.js examples website, but they don't exist at that location.

### Solution:

1. Create a `sounds` folder in your project root directory
2. Add these sound files to the folder:
   - `collect.ogg`
   - `hit.ogg`
   - `shoot.ogg`
   - `jump.ogg`

3. Update the `createAudio()` function in `objects.js` with the new paths (see the "Fixed createAudio Function" artifact)

## Error 2: Missing FBXLoader Dependency

The error `THREE.FBXLoader: External library fflate.min.js required` occurs because the FBXLoader requires a compression library that's not included in your HTML file.

### Solution:

Add the fflate library to your `index.html` file before loading the FBXLoader:

```html
<!-- Add the missing fflate dependency for FBXLoader -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fflate@0.7.4/umd/index.min.js"></script>
```

## Optional Improvements

1. **Audio Fallbacks**: The updated `createAudio()` function includes fallback sound generation if the audio files can't be loaded.

2. **Error Handling**: Better error handling has been added to give more informative messages in the console when files can't be loaded.

3. **Character Model Issues**: If you still have problems loading the character FBX models, consider:
   - Using GLB/GLTF models instead, which have better support in Three.js
   - Adding a simple placeholder model as a fallback
   - Checking if the FBX file paths are correct

## Directory Structure

Your project directory should look like this:

```
adventure-world/
├── js/
│   ├── config.js
│   ├── debug.js
│   ├── environment.js
│   ├── game.js
│   ├── objects.js
│   └── utils.js
├── sounds/
│   ├── collect.ogg
│   ├── hit.ogg
│   ├── jump.ogg

├── animations/
│   ├── Idle.fbx
│   ├── Run.fbx
│   └── Jump.fbx

└── index.html
```

## Testing

After making these changes:

1. Open the browser console (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console)
2. Refresh the page
3. Check for any remaining errors
4. If you still see the FBX loading error, verify that the `fflate` library is loaded before the FBXLoader
